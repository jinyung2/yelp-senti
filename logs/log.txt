Curated data to be used in project by writing a script to perform removal of extraneous attributes in JSON file. Further trimmed file to fit size limits of usage on ambari-node5 server. Removed review text with length < 1000 to guarantee only larger reviews will be analyzed (better word vector outcome).
Time Spent: 2 hours

Pre-processed data some more, no longer JSON files, instead each line is comma separated by STARS, REVIEW_TEXT. This saves some additional file space on and makes it easier to deal with the data in scala code since scala does not have a native way of handling JSON files.
