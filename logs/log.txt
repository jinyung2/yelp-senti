Curated data to be used in project by writing a script to perform removal of extraneous attributes in JSON file. Further trimmed file to fit size limits of usage on ambari-node5 server. Removed review text with length < 1000 to guarantee only larger reviews will be analyzed (better word vector outcome).
Time Spent: 2 hours

Pre-processed data some more, no longer JSON files, instead each line is comma separated by STARS, REVIEW_TEXT. This saves some additional file space on and makes it easier to deal with the data in scala code since scala does not have a native way of handling JSON files.
Time Spent: 1 hour

Jin : 3/14
Researched TF-IDF and KNN methods for use in project. Put together a document for brainstorming ideas and discussing general project overview.
Time Spent: 2 hour

Refactored code from App.scala main driver into a separate class. Fiddled with serializable properties in scala to allow sparkContext to be used in other classes. Created a case class within the tfidf class to encapsulate some data for a specific review.
TF-IDF vector with (word, weight)  for specific reviews is implemented and working.
Time Spent: 5 hours

Integrated Nithya's cosine similarity and KNN into our existing code base.
Time Spent: 6 hours

Kiran : 3/16
Got stop word data from online source. Processed data to remove stop words from reviews.
Time Spent: 1 hour

Kiran : 3/17
Met with team to discuss next steps. Researched tf-idf and associated formulas. Created maps for term frequency, document frequency, inverse document frequency, and tf-idf values.
Time spent: 4 hours

Worked on creating base structure for project report.
Time spent: 2 hour

Polina: 3/16
Researched and learned more on TF-IDF algoithm and its implementation on our project. Also looked at how other projects also utilized yelp reviews and ranked their ratings based on defined hueristic values outside of the standard positive and negative reviews.
Time Spent: 2 hours

Contributed towards the creationg ot eh slide deck, going over all the aspects of the project and collecting the appropriate data from each team member that participated, as well as analyzing the results for how each part was completed and how this affected the reviews being collected.
Time Spent: 3 hours
